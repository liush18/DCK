## Decoupled Clock Products

Decoupled clocks are arranged in this order:

Code clock (s),	Phase clock (s), 	Wide-lane bias (cycle) and their STDs.

## Update

### 2021-09-08

1. Change the file extension from dck to clk;

2. Update AR strategy from week **2143** to avoid clock instability.

**Bug** :  

The header file is incomplete, but it does not affect the use of the clocks. 

Abnormal satellites are not effectively rejected, for example G08 in week 2143 dow 5.
